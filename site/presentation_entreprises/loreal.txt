<h3>A propos de l'entreprise </h3><br>

<strong>L'Oréal, yes but do you really know us? </strong>

Yes, we know that you think you know L’Oréal - you might even think of red lipstick and high-heels. Well, for those of you who did, let us tell you one thing: that’s not who we are and that’s not what we are looking for. Truth be told more than 40% of our French work force is masculine (and most of us are wearing sneakers by the way)! What you do need is a passion for people, pace and a visionary mindset on how to disrupt the #future!  <br>

<strong>Now, let’s talk numbers : </strong><br> 
<ul>
<li>Our position: No. 1 - L’Oréal is the leader worldwide in the cosmetics industry  

<li>Our turnover: 26,9 Billion Euros of consolidated turnover  

<li>Our reach: we are present in 150 countries  

<li>Our strength: 86,000 passionate employees and 36 international brands  

<li>Our commitment: Global environment leader with triple A score in climate change, water security and forests (given by the CDP)  
</ul>
Beauty is our DNA. From the very first hair dye L’Oréal produced in 1909 to our innovative Beauty Tech products and services today, our company has been a pure player and leader in the beauty sector worldwide for decades. <br>

We believe that beauty, the quest for beauty, unites us all. It is a fundamental need that goes beyond mere “appearance” and taps deep into human aspirations: a sense of belonging, self-realization, self-confidence... We strive to help women and men all over the world fulfill these aspirations, while understanding and respecting all the nuances in cultures, needs and traditions. <br>

And so our mission is to offer to all women and men on the planet the best of beauty in terms of quality, efficacy, safety and responsibility. With such strong foundations, we conceive and build an infinite diversity of beauty products and services – in order to share the best of beauty with everyone, everywhere. <br>

Our 36 International brands are looking for courageous minds, challenging innovators and strategic out-of-the-box thinkers. <br><br>
